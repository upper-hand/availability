This is a proof of concept based on [Devin McCabe's subscriptions-with-ruby](https://github.com/dpmccabe/subscriptions-with-ruby) repository.

The adaptation handles time as well as dates, and adds support for yearly frequencies. Finally, the main class and it's public interface has been renamed to clearly reflect its intent to work with recurring events, not just recurring subscriptions.

This is a work-in-progress.
