# availability - easily and quickly calculate schedule availability

[![Build Status][travis-availability-png]][travis-availability]
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/availability.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/availability)

This library uses modular arithmetic and residue classes to calculate schedule availability for dates. Time ranges within a date are handled differently. The goal is to create an easy-to-use API for schedule availability that is very fast and lightweight that is also easy and lightweight to persist in a database.

Shout out to @dpmccabe for his [original article](http://dmcca.be/2014/01/09/recurring-subscriptions-with-ruby-rspec-and-modular-arithmetic.html) and code.

```
gem install availability
```
